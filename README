This repository contains Haskell code that I wrote during my Spring 2012 class
in introductory number theory (MATH 3110). It is not a unified piece of code,
but rather the result of me trying to implement various pieces of number-
theoretic functionality based on interest in that class.

Since the end of that class, I have written some additional code that belongs
here. I have also touched up the readability and comments in the existing code.
